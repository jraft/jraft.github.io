      <h1 class="heading-25">1. What “Personal Information” means</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">In this Policy, “Personal Information” means information or an information set that identifies or could be used to identify an individual directly or indirectly. Except as described in this Policy, Jraft will not give, sell, rent, or loan any Personal Information to any third party.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Personal Information does not include “Usage Data” which we define as encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data we collect about a group or category of services, features, or users which does not contain personally identifying information. Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers’ needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and marketing purposes.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">Cookies on customer sites</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We do not add any cookies to customer sites. The cookies described in this Policy only apply to Jraft&#x27;s own marketing and product pages, not websites that are created and hosted using Jraft. Customers may make changes to their websites at their own discretion that may cause cookies to be added (for example, enabling Google Analytics, using a Facebook Like button, or adding custom code), but these changes are optional and not made by Jraft.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">Third-party cookies</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Cookies set by us are called &quot;first-party cookies,&quot; while cookies set by others are called &quot;third-party cookies.&quot; A third-party cookie can recognize your device both when it visits our Services and when it visits certain other websites or mobile apps. Jraft does not control how third-party cookies are used, so you should check the website of a third-party cookie provider for more information about how they are used.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Both first-party and third-party cookies can serve many functions, including analytics, marketing, and advertising. For more information about how you can control advertising or analytics cookies, please see the relevant section below.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We do not track or respond to browser “Do Not Track” requests.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">Cookies and your Personal Information</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Some cookies are associated with your account and Personal Information, while others are not. We generally treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑Personal information. However, to the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered Personal Information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as Personal Information. If we combine non-Personal Information with Personal Information, then the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">Why Jraft uses cookies and similar tracking technologies</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Jraft uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to enable functionality on its Services, and to assist with marketing its products and services to interested individuals. Cookies help us improve by telling us our Services are being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and overall ensuring you enjoy your browsing experience on our Services.

To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “Help,” “Tools,” or “Edit” settings). However, please be aware that if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access secure areas of the Services and other parts of the Services may also not work properly.</p>

      <h1 class="heading-25">Advertising and/or analytics cookies Jraft uses and how to control them</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We use third-party advertising and analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to share offers with individuals who may be interested in our Services. The Services primarily use the following advertising and/or analytical tools, for which we include relevant privacy information and opt-out options:</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">If you would like more information about cookies and targeted advertisements, please visit <a href="#" class="blog-link">https://www.allaboutcookies.org.</a> In addition, if you would like to opt out of interest-based targeting provided by participating ad servers, you may do so through the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="#" class="blog-link">http://optout.aboutads.info/</a>), the Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="#" class="blog-link">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1</a>), or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="#" class="blog-link">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>). In addition, on your iPhone, iPad or Android mobile device, you can change your device settings to control whether you see online interest-based ads.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">Jraft&#x27;s use of log files</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Jraft gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes an anonymized internet protocol address as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, search terms, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">Jraft&#x27;s use of clear GIFs/web beacons</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">Changes to Jraft&#x27;s Cookie Policy</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update this Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will endeavor to notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Sites prior to the change becoming effective, but will not be liable for any failure to do so. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance to be bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service.</p>
