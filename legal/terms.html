Any natural persons accessing or using your Storipress account, the websites, pages, features, or content created by you on our Services are deemed your “End Users.” Storipress does not have a direct relationship with any of your End Users, therefore Storipress is not responsible for how you handle End User information.</p><p class="legal-paragraph-text"><strong>Applicable laws.</strong> You may have additional obligations under local law other than those described in this Terms of Service, particularly if you or your End Users are located outside of the Australia. Such obligations may be more restrictive than this Terms of Service.

When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the “last modified” date at the top of this page.

Storipress reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification by contacting us at hello@storipress.com. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Service and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. The Terms of Service will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p><h1 class="heading-25">15. Dispute resolution</h1><p class="legal-paragraph-text">INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Storipress agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Storipress. Storipress&#x27; address for such notices is Albion Media Pty. Ltd, 8 Brewer Avenue, Liberty Grove, Sydney, Australia 2138.</p><p class="legal-paragraph-text">BINDING ARBITRATION. If you and Storipress are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Storipress will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Storipress may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p><p class="legal-paragraph-text">EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court located within New South Wales, Australia with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p><p class="legal-paragraph-text">WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You and Storipress agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Storipress and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Storipress ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Storipress otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” Section will be deemed null and void.</p><p class="legal-paragraph-text">LOCATION OF ARBITRATION. Arbitration will take place in New South Wales, Australia. You and Storipress agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the New South Wales District and Federal courts located in Sydney, Australia have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Storipress agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p><h1 class="heading-25">16. Miscellaneous</h1><h1 class="heading-26">a. Assignment</h1><p class="legal-paragraph-text">This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Storipress without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p><h1 class="heading-26">b. Governing law, international use, and users</h1><p class="legal-paragraph-text">The Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New South Wales, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in Sydney, New South Wales, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue.</p><p class="legal-paragraph-text">The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the Australia.

Attorneys’ and accountants’ fees, remedies</h1><p class="legal-paragraph-text">In any action to enforce the Terms of Service, the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorneys’ and accountants’ fees and costs.</p><p class="legal-paragraph-text">You agree that Storipress&#x27; remedy at law for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that Storipress shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief, or both, in addition to any damages that Storipress may be legally entitled to recover, together with reasonable expenses of any form of dispute resolution, including, without limitation, attorneys&#x27; fees.</p><p class="legal-paragraph-text">No right or remedy of Storipress shall be exclusive of any other, whether at law or in equity, including without limitation damages injunctive relief, attorneys&#x27; fees, and expenses.</p><p class="legal-paragraph-text">No instance of waiver by Storipress of its rights or remedies under these terms and conditions shall imply any obligation to grant any similar, future, or other waiver.</p></div></div><footer class="footer-section footer"><div class="footer-flex-container"><div class="div-block-1402"><div class="footer-logo-contact-div"><a href="../index" class="footer-logo-link w-inline-block"><img src="../images/SP-Logo-WHITE.svg" width="152" alt="" class="footer-logo-image"></a><div class="footer-text location">Sydney, Australia<br>Taipei + Taichung, Taiwan<br></div><div class="div-block-3"><a href="mailto:hello@storipress.com?subject=To%20my%20mates%20%40%20Storipress%20..." class="footer-contact-buttons w-inline-block"><img src="../images/email.svg" loading="lazy" alt="Email symbol"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Storipress" target="_blank" class="footer-contact-buttons w-inline-block"><img src="../images/facebook.svg" loading="lazy" alt="Facebook Logo"></a><a href="https://www.twitter.com/Storipress" target="_blank" class="footer-contact-buttons w-inline-block"><img src="../images/twitter.svg" loading="lazy" alt="Twitter Logo"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/19119329/" target="_blank" class="footer-contact-buttons w-inline-block"><img src="../images/LinkedIn-Logo.svg" loading="lazy" alt="LinkedIn Logo" class="image-68"></a></div></div><div class="div-block-1455"><div class="footer-div"><h5 class="footer-list-heading">Product</h5><ul role="list" class="w-list-unstyled"><li><a href="../manage" class="footer-text">Workflow</a></li><li><a href="../create" class="footer-text">Editor</a></li><li><a href="../build" class="footer-text">Builder</a></li><li><a href="../engage" class="footer-text">Engage &amp; Earn</a></li><li><a href="../hosting" class="footer-text">Hosting &amp; Performance</a></li><li><a href="../pricing" class="footer-text">Pricing</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-div"><h5 class="footer-list-heading">Compare</h5><ul role="list" class="w-list-unstyled"><li><a href="../vs/wordpress" class="footer-text">WordPress</a></li><li><a href="../vs/wix" class="footer-text">Wix</a></li><li><a href="../vs/medium" class="footer-text">Medium</a></li><li><a href="../vs/wordpress" class="footer-text">WordPress: Hidden Costs</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-div hidden"><h5 class="footer-list-heading">Company</h5><ul role="list" class="w-list-unstyled"><li class="list-item-4"><a href="https://github.com/f2etw/jobs/issues/798" target="_blank" class="footer-text">Careers</a><div class="text-block-61">We&#x27;re hiring!</div></li><li><a href="../legal/terms" aria-current="page" class="footer-text w--current">Terms of Service</a></li><li><a href="../legal/global-privacy-policy" class="footer-text">Global Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../legal/publisher-agreement" class="footer-text">Publisher Agreement</a></li><li><a href="../legal/content-guidelines" class="footer-text">Content Guidelines</a></li><li><a href="../legal/cookie-policy" class="footer-text">Cookie Policy</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="footer-copyright-notice">© Storipress.
